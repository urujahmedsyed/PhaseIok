# PhaseI
The focus of my current Agri-Genomics project involves predicting plant height and subpopulation of Oryza Sativa (rice) using machine learning
algorithms. The project's goal is to leverage these algorithms to improve predictions and increase accuracy in predicting plant height and
subpopulation. In the course of this project, I have gathered substantial knowledge, which I presented in a video that includes a sample prediction
at the end. The video provides a comprehensive overview of the methods used and the insights gained, highlighting the relevance and potential of
machine learning techniques in Agri-Genomics research.
